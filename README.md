# Jackson's various eagle resources
This is where I pile in all the library devices, DRU, and CAM I've used for various projects.

Though most of the resources in this repo are my of my creation, some are copied over from other places.

For the libraries, all parts (should) have been designed with a .1" grid in mind, and the alt grid being a factor of 1/2 of .1" (I often use .00625" or .003125" as my alt grid).

All board text (should) be vector, .024" size, and 16% ratio.
All symbol text (should) be proportional, and .07" size.
